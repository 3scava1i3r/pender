For the most part, it's a decent system, specially for software development. All the tools are there. For presentation, I tried LibreOffice Impress and it's useless. Whenever I add an image it slows down terribly even with added memory cache and hardware acceleration. It's a shame. Google Slides is just too simple. Only Microsoft Powerpoint can almost match but usability is still terrible. Apple Keynote is unparalleled. I am a Brazilian and I type a lot of text in Brazilian Portuguese, but I prefer to have my system in English. But I found that ibus or something in between is messing around and if try to use US International keyboard layout with dead keys, the cedilla (ç) don't work by accenting the 'c'. Only when I change the system language to pt_BR.UTF-8 I can do proper cedilla and this is a hassle. There are still some other strange usability problems. For example, I like to have a secondary external monitor hooked to the left side of my notebook. I change the positions but it goes back to the right side whenever I log out and log back in or just restart the machine. Brightness settings also don't persist between sessions. Evolution Mail just can't connect to my iCloud IMAP account. Thunderbird Mail is a bit better and it was able to connect properly. Microsoft Office is also still unparalleled, LibreOffice is a shame of a useless tool. Only virtualizing Windows and installing Office I can have what I need. And this is without trying to edit videos (iMovies will be missed). So, for 80% of my needs, Ubuntu is great. But I will still have to have my Macbook Pro around for the other 20%, I'm afraid. Anyone has any tips for those hassles?"

You definitely should to, it changes the way you think about your code."

Fiquei curioso, ninguém nunca fez campanha para soltarem informação interna de governo no WikiLeaks ou similar? Compartilhem, vai que alguém aqui tem conhecidos dentro do governo que só precisam de um empurrãozinho. Tem tanta sujeira no nosso governo que o WikiLeaks sozinho não ia aguentar a quantidade. Você trabalha no governo e tem acesso a informações confidenciais que ajudariam a expôr a corrupção? Poste no WikiLeaks assim:"

I understand that at its time (1941) this movie was unique in terms of the techniques, acting, writing. But it didn\'t age well, unless you really are into movie history, this will not appeal to you. We are used to movies with far better standards and it does not hold up today, which is unfair to say, I know. But for me, watchability is important so I give it a solid 4, out of 10. More than 70 years cannot be considered a spoiler anymore. So the touch I like is that Rosebud may initially be thought as the fond memories of his childhood, before he became rich and miserable. But the real meaning is that Rosebud was what caused him to meet Susan and his entire life went down the toilet. So it\'s understandable that his last word should be Rosebud, the moment his life ended."
